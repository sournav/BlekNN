WORK IN PROGRESS, FINAL CODE WILL BE UPLOADED WHEN CHANGES ARE FINISHED BEING MADE

# BlekNN
A neural network engine I made for fun, entirely in python, with no external libraries, with the bulk of the code having been written in one night. Note that due to the time constraints, certain omptimizations and feautures that may be present in other neural network engines are still yet to be added. 

# Requirements
While as of now the entire project does not need any additional libraries or external dependencies, it has only been tested in python 3.6. Although I have included a few activation and error functions, and their respective derivative functions, these are not using libraries that may optimize the calculation of these values. For example the value of 'e' in the sigmoid function is an approximation.
